Requirement: iOS /6.x/7.x/8.x/9.x + JB (jailbreak)<br />
<br />
Overview:<br />
Without it, you are played by games; with it, you play games in your own rules!<br />
“iGameGuardian” is a game hack/alteration tool for iOS. With it, you can modify money, HP, SP, and much more. You can enjoy the fun part of a game without suffering from its unseasonable part.<br />
<br />
Main Features:<br />
1. Search game value with precise numbers.<br />
2. Search game value with vague instructions, e.g. larger or smaller.<br />
3. Lock the game value to a fixed number.<br />
4. Save/Load the managed list.<br />
5. Memory browser/editor.<br />
<br />
Installation:<br />
* Before install the newer version, please uninstall the old one first.<br />
1. Use the tool like 'iTools' to put the file under directory /var/root/Media/Cydia/AutoInstall/ of your jailbreak iOS device.<br />
2. Reboot your device, it will be installed automatically.<br />
3. Reboot.<br />
4. Pangu -> Utility -> Rebuild App list<br />
(You can also use iFile to install iGG: video. Reboot after installation.)<br />
<br />
Un-installation:<br />
1. Cydia > Manage > Packages > iGameGuardian > Modify > Remove > Confirm<br />
2. Reboot.<br />
<br />
Known Issues:<br />
1. iOS would disable certain sub-systems when the screen is off, that may cause this iGG failed. DO NOT let you screen off when iGameGuardian is busy, e.g. searching, scrolling.<br />
<br />
Warning:<br />
Don't expect it works on every game. Some games may encode the data to prevent from cheating. Some games, especially online games, store data in servers.<br />
<br />
Enjoy playing games in your own way!<br />
<br />
FAQ<br />
<br />
- Can't find the icon in SpringBoard<br />
1. Pangu -> Utility -> Rebuild App list<br />
2. Install other tweaks from Cydia<br />
<br />
- iGG does not work after restoring system<br />
1. Restoring system or upgrading system will clear iGG license. Please email me and providing your WiFi MAC address<br />
<br />
- Keep showing "Please reboot your device"<br />
1. Please don't use tools to kill background processes.<br />
2. Please don't use Flex to hack iGG.<br />
3. Try to delete /var/mobile/Library/com.apple.gg.record2.plist<br />
4. Use VPN if necessary<br />
<br />
- Searching forever<br />
Please check the "Search range" in "More" tab. What's the min and max?<br />
If your device is 32-bit, try [0x0 ~ 0x10000000].<br />

Maybe your should reboot your device after setting the search range.<br />
